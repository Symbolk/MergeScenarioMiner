# MergeMiner

#### A mining tool to collect merge scenarios from Git repositories. In three-way merging, each merge scenario contains the two versions to be merged (called ours and theirs respectively), and their nearest common ancestor in the commit history (called base).

> How to tell which version is ours and which is theirs?

See the following example:

```sh
$ git branch
      develop
    * master
$ git merge develop
$ git log
commit 5aa63defd7d552544348deaad88a22d212c43038 (HEAD -> master)
Merge: 011eeae bdd631b
Author: Symbolk <symbolk@163.com>
Date:   Sat Jul 6 17:12:25 2019 +0800

    Merge branch 'develop'

```

> The current branch `master` is called ours, on which the merge commit will be submitted. The branch `develop` in the `git-merge` command is called theirs, which will not be affected by the merging.

## Getting Started

## Requirements

- Windows/Linux/macOS
- Python 2.7.15
- Git 2.18.0
- PyCharm

## Installation

1. Open the clone repository as a project with PyCharm;
2. Under the root directory of the cloned repository, run the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

---

## Usage

### Usage 1: Collect all merge scenarios with merge conflict(s)

Collect Java files involved in merge scenarios that contain merge conflict(s) from the whole commit history.

#### Input

A Git repository with the name of the target branch (usually `master`). 

Edit the `main.py `  to set the necessary variables, then run it:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    repo_name = "javaparser"
    branch_name = "master"
    # if the repo is not present in the repo_dir, it will be cloned, recommend to clone     # in advance
    git_url = "https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser.git"
    # Windows
    repo_dir = "D:\\github\\repos\\" + repo_name
    result_dir = "D:\\github\\temp\\" + repo_name
    # Linux
    # repo_dir = "/home/github/repos/" + repo_name
    # result_dir = "/home/github/merges" + repo_name
    # macOS
    # repo_dir = "/Users/name/github/repos/" + repo_name
    # result_dir = "/Users/name/githeub/merges" + repo_name

    # Usage1: Collect Java files involved in merge scenarios that contain merge conflict(s) from the whole commit history
    statistic_path = result_dir + "/statistics.csv"
    git_service = GitService(repo_name, repo_dir, branch_name, result_dir)
    git_service.collect_from_repo(statistic_path)
```

#### Output

During the mining process, the brief summary of each merge scenario with merge conflict(s) is printed in the Run console of PyCharm:

Commit: 0258e273bfd2dca550a27d3204cf22227a41e772, #Unmerged_blobs: 5, #Conflict java files: 4, #Conflict blocks: 4
Commit: 25c4bbf796034c987e7517d4d3c596026a0142e3, #Unmerged_blobs: 16, #Conflict java files: 2, #Conflict blocks: 3
...
```

Collected data will be saved in the `result_dir`, which contains:

1. Sub-folders named with merge commit ids, each of them contains conflicting Java files in that merge scenario.

   ![files](https://github.com/Symbolk/MergeMiner/blob/master/screenshots/files.png)

2. A csv file that provides a statistical summary of each merge scenario, which consist of 4 commit ids (merge commit, HEAD of ours/theirs branch, base commit), the number of conflicting Java files and their paths, and the number of conflict blocks.

   ![summary](https://github.com/Symbolk/MergeMiner/blob/master/screenshots/summary.png)

   > In the column #conflict blocks, the numbers denotes the number of conflict blocks in every conflicting Java file. For example, in the first row, there are 5 conflicting Java files, the first file `javaparser-core-serialization/src/main/java/com/github/javaparser/serialization/JavaParserJsonSerializer.java` has 1 conflict block inside it.

### Usage 2: Collect only merge scenarios with refactoring-related conflict(s)

Collect Java files involved in merge scenarios that contain refactoring-related merge conflict(s) from the csv file generated by https://github.com/Symbolk/RefConfMiner.git (python scripts to analyze MySql data generated by <https://github.com/ualberta-smr/RefactoringsInMergeCommits>).

#### Input

1. A Git repository with the name of the target branch (usually the main branch, like  `master`).
2. The csv file that records refactoring-related merge commit ids, generated from the tool RefactoringsInMergeCommits (<https://github.com/ualberta-smr/RefactoringsInMergeCommits>).

Edit the `main.py `  to set the necessary variables, then run it:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    repo_name = "javaparser"
    branch_name = "master"
    # if the repo is not present in the repo_dir, it will be cloned,  recommend to clone in advance
    git_url = "https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser.git"
    # Windows
    repo_dir = "D:\\github\\rep\\" + repo_name
    result_dir = "D:\\github\\temp\\" + repo_name
    # Linux
    # repo_dir = "/home/github/repos/" + repo_name
    # result_dir = "/home/github/merges" + repo_name
    # macOS
    # repo_dir = "/Users/name/github/repos/" + repo_name
    # result_dir = "/Users/name/githeub/merges" + repo_name

    # Usage2: Collect Java files involved in merge scenarios that contain refactoring-related merge conflict(s) 
    # from the csv file generated by https://github.com/Symbolk/RefConfMiner.git
    result_dir = "D:\\github\\ref_conflicts2\\" + repo_name
    result_dir = "D:\\github\\ref_conflicts2\\" + repo_name
    csv_file = "merge_scenarios_involved_refactorings_test.csv"
    csv_file = "F:\\workspace\\dev\\refactoring-analysis-results\\stats\\merge_scenarios_involved_refactorings_" + repo_name + ".csv"
    git_service = GitService(repo_name, repo_dir, branch_name, result_dir)
    git_service.collect_from_csv(csv_file)
```

#### Output

The output is basically same with that in Usage 1.
